# HearMeOut üö®

**Emergency Alerts for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing**

HearMeOut is an AI-powered mobile app that listens for real-world emergency sounds (like "fire," "evacuate," or "earthquake") and instantly alerts deaf and hard-of-hearing users through real-time vibration, flashlight signals, and visual on-screen notifications.
